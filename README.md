## Introduction

Object-oriented programming is a type of programming that uses objects and classes for functioning. Generally, object-oriented programming binds the variable and functions in a single entity to restrict its usage. Most of the concept of Object Oriented Programming is from real world.

## Objects and classes

**Classes**: class contains the data member and member functions which is also called class methods.

**Objects**: Object is an instance of a class which means that we can access the data member and class method by creating an object of a class.

## Concepts of Object Oriented Programming

- **Encapsulation** : Encapsulation is the concept of      wrapping together data and information in a single unit.
  eg In an organization there are several batches each batch binds different students and study material.

- **Polymorphism:** : One name many form , in real world  persons can have different mood angry,love,etc . In object oriented programming this is used in operator overloading and operator overriding.

- **Inheritance** : It is the property of a class to inherit properties from other class . It reduces the time to create the variable or methods again and again. The class which derives properties from another class is called child class and the class from which the property is inherited is called parent class.

- **Abstraction** : Hiding of data is called data abstraction . In real world when you ride a bike you don't know the internal working of bike or internal parts of bike just like this we show final working of a software to user not the whole code.

## Code to make a class in Python

```python
class MyClass:
  x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```
Output: 5

This is a simple class program where p1 is an object and it is accessing the variable of a class.
